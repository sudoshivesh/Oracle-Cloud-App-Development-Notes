    Become a Cloud App Developer

    Sir guidance: 

- Key Feature of Oracle Cloud Platform (Why to choose OCP)
    - Open: In term of choosing language/open source technology. Oracle Java SE, Python, Ruby, PHP, Oracle javascript Extension Tool (JET)
    - Modern: In tern of architectural styles/ tools (Agile/DevOps)
    - Easy: in terms of ease of integration
- it offers a **second genration cloud**

### Application Development Services
- Four major application development cloud services
    - Visual Builder Studio
    - Oracle Mobile Hub
    - Oracle Digital Assistant
    - Oracle Blockchain

- Applicationn Deployment Services
    - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
    - WebLogic Server for OCI
    - Microservice and Containers
    - Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE)

### Application Deployment Service

- Oracle Cloud Interface
    - It is a set of Complementary cloud services in Oracle Genration 2 Cloud. It can be used to configure many different components required for Oracle Cloud.
    - OCI also enables the user to build and run a wide range of applications and services in a highly available hosted environment.
    - OCI offers high-performance physical hardware and storage devices. It also offers a flexible overlay of virtual networks.
    - Using the resources available in OCI, a user can set up, configure and use various Cloud Services.
    - When you sign in to the OCI, you can see this OCI Console homepage.
    - Various categories of Cloud service accessible via the console: Core Infrastructure, Database, Platform, AI, Monitoring and diagnostics.
 
- More about OCI
    - OCI is hosted as region and availability domain. Organised as region, domain, tenancy and compartment.
    - A region is a localized geographical area composed of one or more availablity domains. Most OCI resources are either **region-specific** or **availability domain-specific**


    - There are **20+ region** available in the OCI. These region are in the US, UK, Canada and Japan
    - Availability Domains : An **availability domain** is one or more data centers located within a region. They are isolated from each other, fault tolerant, and very unlikely to fail simultaneously. They do not share infrastructure such as power or cooling or the internal availability domain network. Hence, a failure in one domain is unlikely to impact the availability of the others. All the domains in a region are connected to each other by a low-latency and high-bandwidth network.
    - Talking of **tenancy**, when a user signs up for OCI resources, Oracle creates a tenancy for the user organization. A tenancy is a secure and isolated partition within OCI where a user can create, organize, and administer the cloud resources. All the resources for hosting the client applications are created within the tenancy. The administrator can use the OCI console to manage the tenancy.
    - On compartments, a compartment is a logical group within a domain and not a physical container. When a user signs up for OCI, Oracle creates a tenancy, which is the group compartment that holds all the Cloud resources. The compartment contains a collection of related resources such as instances, virtual cloud, networks, log volumes, and many more. The compartment allows the user to organize and control access to cloud resources. It can be accessed only by certain groups who've been given permission assigned by an administrator. The administrator can control the compartment by setting up the policy. A user can create additional compartments within the tenancy and set up corresponding policies to control the access of resources in each compartment.
